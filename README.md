# SudokuSolver with no recursion
# Written by Ronen Zyroff in 2019
 - Solves Sudoku boards with CLI interactive python code.
 - Supports finding multiple solutions for 1 board.
 - Saves last-inputted board for future recall.
 - One of the only Sudoku-solving algorithms that uses hardcoded backtracking instead of recursion.
 - Contains a "progress bar" in CLI format, and an ETA (good for really hard or impossible Sudoku Boards or boards with multiple solutions).
